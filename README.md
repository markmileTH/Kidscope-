# Kidscope-
This is project for fun hahaha!
“This project was inspired by conflicts and ambush shooting scenarios. The differences in each type of projectile help illustrate the underlying principles of operation, while also incorporating fundamental physics knowledge. Most importantly, this project is not intended to support or promote criminal activities.”
